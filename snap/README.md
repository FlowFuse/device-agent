# FlowForge Device Agent Snap Package

This is the README file for the FlowForge Device Agent Snap package, which allows you to manage Node-RED instances running on remote devices using the FlowForge platform. The snap package includes the device agent and configuration files necessary for connecting to a FlowForge platform instance and receiving updates.

For the complete documentation see the [README file](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge-device-agent#flowforge-device-agent) of the npm package and the [FlowForge Website](https://flowforge.com/docs/user/devices/)

## Installation

To install the FlowForge Device Agent Snap package, run the following command:

```
sudo snap install flowforge-device-agent
```

## Configuration

2. Copy the `device.yml` file provided by the FlowForge platform to the writable directory at `$SNAP_USER_DATA/flowforge-device/device.yml` or modify the template.
